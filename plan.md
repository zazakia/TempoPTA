# TempoPTA Web App Development Plan

## Project Overview
TempoPTA is a comprehensive PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) payment management system built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The application handles payment tracking, student management, and financial reporting for school PTA activities.

## Current Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Development**: Tempo DevTools for enhanced development experience

## Current Application Structure

### Database Schema
- **Teachers**: Employee management with salary, classes, and status tracking
- **Parents**: Contact information and payment status
- **Students**: Student records linked to parents and teachers
- **Payments**: Transaction records with receipts and payment methods

### Features Implemented
1. **Dashboard**: Statistics cards and payment overview
2. **Payment Recording**: Form for recording PTA payments
3. **Student Status**: Payment status tracking by student
4. **Parent Management**: CRUD operations for parent records
5. **Student Management**: Student enrollment and information management
6. **Teacher Management**: Staff management system
7. **Reports**: Financial reporting and data export capabilities

## Development Roadmap
